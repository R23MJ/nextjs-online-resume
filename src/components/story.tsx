      <p>
        Hi, I&apos;m Shea Harrington, a passionate and versatile developer with
        nearly two decades of programming experience. My earlist experience with
        programming began with C++ where I learned about algorithms and honed my
        problem solving skills. Over the years, I&apos;ve expanded my expertise
        to include Python, crafting bespoke Discord bots tailored to specific
        needs and communities. More recently, I&apos;ve ventured into the
        dynamic world of web development, specializing in React and Next.js.
        Whether Iâ€™m building responsive web applications or creating tailored
        backend solutions, I thrive on delivering high-quality, user-focused
        results.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m currently seeking new opportunities to further develop my
        skills and contribute to exciting projects. If you&apos;re interested in
        working together, please don&apos;t hesitate to get in touch!
      </p>
